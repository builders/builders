        <p>Design is evolving from physical artifacts to human experience:
        perception (senses), cognition (mind), emotion (heart), and action
        (body). The future of design and architecture may be in the integration
        of the separate disciplines to learn how interconnected systems work and
        model the built environment to imitate the processes of living
        organisms.</p>

        <p>The ethics of design is at the forefront of our discussions as we
        have again come to realize that technology is not a neutral force in the
        world. Rather, technology is the means by which humanity gains the power
        to destroy or to create.</p>
